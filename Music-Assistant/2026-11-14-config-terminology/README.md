Repository: `music-assistant/server` (`dev` at `8b1c3fb4e5c2411b5c97a247129876ebbf0f09e9`)

Release freshness: 2.10.11 was published 2026-11-13.

## Reviewed changes

- `AirPlay-specifika inställningar`
- `Aktivera stöd för {0}`
- source-aligned help for flow mode and the shared Music Assistant icon set
- an idiomatic TTS pre-announcement description using `klocksignal`
- corrected loudness terminology: `ljudklippning`, not interrupted audio
- `förinläsning` in the infinite-mix description; the em dash remains because it is present in the source
- `Alla favoritspår`
- `Visning`, `Synkroniserings- och importalternativ` och `Utgångskanalläge`
- consistent `favoritspår` terminology in the infinite-mix variant
- ten missing, context-clear configuration categories, including `Automatisk uppspelning`, `Klickåtgärder`, `Felsökning`, `Källval` and placeholder-preserving protocol support labels

## Checks

- JSON parsing passed.
- `l10n-lint` passed.
- Targeted `svlang` review found only known false positives for the product names AirPlay and TTS, and for valid Swedish inversion.
- Targeted `hunspell -d sv_SE -l` ran with `nice -n 10`; it flagged only AirPlay. No Hunspell process remained afterward.
- `git diff --check` and Gitleaks passed.
- `msgfmt` is not applicable to this JSON catalog.

## Upstream status

Submitted as [music-assistant/server#7640](https://github.com/music-assistant/server/pull/7640), branch `yeager:l10n/sv-config-terminology-20261114`, latest commit `769d2b713c4a647fda9e77e9fe0ae96e71de5798`.

The PR is open. Its initial repository verification requests the project's full pre-commit and pytest checklist. Those commands are unavailable in the sparse review checkout, which lacks both the repository runner and its Python 3.14 environment; the PR body records that limitation rather than claiming checks that did not run. Repository lint passed; its three pytest jobs are still pending. It has not received maintainer review or been merged.
