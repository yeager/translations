        <note from="NCAA" priority="4">@kbh4:
I'm fully aware of this fact that you refer to.

That its use is considered voluntary doesn't mean that accent char shouldn't be applied though.

Especially in mobile apps often used on smaller screens, the use of accent chars helps the user to more quickly absorb messages, which means that it should be used extensively in this environment -- not based on spelling rules, but simply to aid the user to a better overall experience when reading texts in general in this environment.

Secondly, there're already approved DA outputs in this project containing the accent chars, so, to the user, this fact unnecessarily breaks the homogeneity in the project's use of the written language in Danish.

In conclusion, my recommendation is to definitely use the accent char wherever possible.
It aids the ordinary reader (i.e. readers/users without any special training in specific methods of reading and interpretation) in their effort to understand messages, on the conscious as well as on the unconscious level (where the accent char aids on the unconscious level).

Personally, I always use the accent char based on the above argumentations. After all, as translators, our primary objectives are to convey messages/meanings/info etc. as precise as possible and in the easiest comprehensible way possible.</note>

Also, please note that even if a term sounds technical, that shouldn't be the sole argument for not using it.

        <note from="NCAA" priority="4">@kbh4:
Yes, I'm aware of this recommendation.
However, "Internet" is a unique phenomenon, so writing it in this specific way (or as 'internet') means it doesn't need to be subjected to any other forms, merely "Internet" suffices, since users will not be in doubts as to its precise meaning. The added bonus here, it keeps the overall word count down, which is always a to be preferred.</note>
        <note from="Kent B. Hansen (kbh4)" priority="4">@NCAA I don't think "the internet" is any more unique than for instance "the sun", which has the "-en" ending (sol/solen) in Danish. It's not a 'product' like Facebook, where you wouldn't put it that form ("connect to the Facebook/Opret forbindelse til Facebook'en"). I believe "internet" is a normal noun, which should have "-tet" in the precise form (https://dsn.dk/?retskriv=internet&amp;ae=0)</note>
        <note from="NCAA" priority="4">@kbh4:
You're not incorrect in that it certainly can be written using the forms you describe, but it can also be written using just its simple form.

Personally, I just don't see the need to use any other forms, since it doesn't really benefit the user in any way, it merely adds to the overall letter count of the project.

As the PR for Danish on this project, it's your call, of course.</note>

The personal form ("versuche es erneut"), which you use for friends and people you know well, and the less personal and more polite form "versuchen Sie es erneut". Some apps only use one form, some only the other one. Mixing looks strange. I try to make all translations here "neutral" and thus avoiding either form (neutral also mixes with both forms). When neutral is not possible or sounds strange, I use the more polite form (looks more like a professional business product if you do).</note>
        <note from="Johannes (j_kers)" priority="4">Hi CodingMarkus! You're right, referring should be common accross all translations. So far, we have a mix of both variants - I felt like more of the current translation were using the informal way and went with it in my translations. It seems to be quite common to use the informal way within apps. The neutral form would of course elegantly avoid the issue - allthough I find it a bit artificial. @kspearrin , which of the two (or three) options do you prefer?</note>

Once again, this is a question of homogeneity in the used language.

Since "log ind" appears elsewhere in the DA outputs, the logical choice (language rules aside) is to use "log ud" rather than "log af".
Btw., which references are you referring to specifically?</note>

        <note from="Kent B. Hansen (kbh4)" priority="4">@NCAA I don't think the "boks" is a proprium or product itself - therefore it shoudn't have a capital "B" (https://dsn.dk/retskrivning/retskrivningsregler/a7-11-14/a7-12)</note>
        <note from="NCAA" priority="4">@kbh4 :
The problem with referencing Dansk Sprognævn and abiding blindly by their recommendations for all and every phrasing is that it doesn't always present the best and most intuitive solution when it comes to the lingo used in software.

Whenever possible, their recommendations should be followed, of course, however, the paramount consideration here (localizing software texts) is the user's comprehension and experience when using the software and reading the UI texts.

"Vault" is used in many apps, and most often the DA output is "boks"/"Boks". Apart from promoting the user's intuitive experience, as mentioned elsewhere, the fact that this isn't an unambiguous DA translation of "vault" would fully justify it standing out when read by the user and the logical way to make this happen is to use an initial capital letter -- DSN recommendations aside.</note>

Basically, I agree with you on that.

However, there may be varying situations warranting the use of one over the other, but in cases such as this one, where the author explicitly is using website rather than homepage, the output might as well stay true to the lingo chosen by the author/copywriter.

I suspect one of the reasons for using website is that this might give the impression of a certain size/significance, but that's just my own unsubstantiated theory.</note>

OK, if you say so. Personally, I use Android in its AE setup, so I don't actually know the precise wording in DA.

Can't say, however, that a DA translation of "accessibility-something" to "hjælpe-dit" or "hjælpe-dat" makes much sense to me. But then again, there're other Android translations that aren't that great or logic either.

If the DA output should be something like "hjælpe-", then I beleive the original term should've been "auxiliary -", definitely not "accessibility -".

The ideal scenario is, of course, that the terms from the OS translation are used, but this sounds like an all together botched translation by Google.</note>

        <note from="Jackonya" priority="4">@anm ну Вы же не только логины заполняете, но и пароли. Возможно все же более уместно: "автоматического входа."</note>
        <note from="Andrey (anm)" priority="4">@Jackonya bitwarden -средство автозаполнения, а не автовхода. Под логином в менеджерах паролей понимается связка имя пользователя-пароль</note>
        <note from="Jackonya" priority="4">@anm "logins" в данном контексте может трактоваться как "входы". каким образом терминология менеджеров паролей может отличаться от общепринятой? "автозаполнение данных" по сути близко к "автовход", нет? пара логин-пароль входит в понятие "учетная запись", так правильнее, но длиннее и нужно перестраивать общий стиль. поэтому, на мой взгляд, по смыслу и эстетике было бы употребить "автоматический вход"</note>
        <note from="Andrey (anm)" priority="4">@Jackonya не соглашусь</note>
        <note from="Jackonya" priority="4">@anm зря)) слишком похоже на машинный перевод</note>
        <note from="Andrey (anm)" priority="4">@Jackonya логин образует пару имя пользователя-пароль. Большинство менеджеров паролей (говорим только о гигантах типа keepass, 1Password, roboform и несколько других) использует термин "Логин" в описанном виде. Машинный перевод, кстати, используется в большинстве ваших версий перевода. Я предлагаю вам заниматься переводом, а не изложением версий восприятия действительности. Сообщество переводчиков само выберет наилучший вариант. Возможно это займёт некоторое время (пока к нашему проекту присоединятся ещё несколько человек), но перевод будет и он будет качественным. Можете не переживать.</note>
        <note from="Jackonya" priority="4">@anm Версия восприятия действительности, в действительности, несколько иное, простите за каламбур, нежели локализация. Я пытаюсь смотреть на проект с точки зрения простого  пользователя, и излагать для простоты восприятия терминов, не более. Извините если чем то задел Вас.
P.S. Образ мышления и культура различных народов весьма отличаются. Например, в английском языке просто нет обращения "Вы" с большой буквы, а в русском оно присутствует. Почему в русской локализации не сделать с учетом нашего языка и культуры, а не как проще?</note>
        <note from="Andrey (anm)" priority="4">@Jackonya относитесь проще к переводам. Со стороны ваши версии выглядят как истина в последней инстанции. Исходите из того, что тоже можете ошибаться.
Местоимения Вы, Ваш пишутся с прописной буквы при обращении к одному лицу в текстах следующих жанров:
а) личное письмо (адресат – одно лицо); 
б) официальные документы, адресованные одному лицу; 
в) анкеты, рекламные листовки (текст, адресованный неконкретному лицу).
Это цитата с Грамоты.Ру.
Общепринято при переводе приложений и интерфейсов сайтов использовать написание со строчной буквы. С заглавной если и встретишь, то это будет непрофессиональный перевод. Кстати, с недавних пор написание Вы с большой буквы появилось в OSx - назовем это исключением. Может к сентябрю (новому релизу) исправят.
Практически все серьезные фирмы в инструкциях по переводам указывают, что писать вы нужно с маленькой буквы (например Xiaomi). Также принято не использовать букву "ё" в переводах.</note>

"Utilize o serviço de acessibilidade bitwarden para autopreencher as suas credenciais."</note>
        <note from="Romoaldo Cordeiro dos Santos Júnior (Romoaldo)" priority="4">@K0media Coloquei a palavra "credenciais" por acreditar que englobaria Usuário e Senha. Como um cartão de acesso que contém informações para acessar locais restritos. A forma coloquial seria de fato a palavra "Login(s)", mas estou tentando ser fiel a língua portuguesa, evitando estrangeirismo caso haja equivalente no nosso idioma.

Aguardo sua resposta para chegarmos a um consenso. Abraço!</note>
        <note from="Gabriel Ribeiro (K0media)" priority="4">@Romoaldo certo. Vamos seguir então com "credenciais" mesmo.

Eu prefiro "login(s)" mais por uma questão do termo já estar no dialeto brasileiro, e reconheço isso.
Até porque costumo ver mais gente falando "Entre com o seu login e senha" (mais direto) do que "Entre com suas credenciais" (mais genérico) em vários lugares.

Mas é uma questão de gosto. Vamos continuar com "credenciais" mesmo, se você preferir. Vou fazer as correções nos locais onde adicionei e votei isso.</note>
        <note from="Romoaldo Cordeiro dos Santos Júnior (Romoaldo)" priority="4">@K0media Fique a vontade para negativar as minhas sugestões e aprovações. Se possível, faça uma versão com a forma que você colocaria para que outros contribuintes possam votar. Caso o seu seja o mais votado, eu aprovo.

De qualquer forma, essa não é uma tradução definitiva. Sempre estou usando o aplicativo e analisando qual forma se adéqua melhor. Sugestione, no futuro posso mudar.</note>

Yup, you're absolutely correct.

My argument for using it (in software and thus disregarding DSN) is that it helps break compound words into a 'digestible' sizes for anyone who's not a strong reader and that in this case, we're furthermore talking about compounding a non-indigenous DA word with an indigenous ditto.

However, if I were in you shoes, I'd also stick with the "e-mailaddresse" output as suggested by DSN.

Andrei, când o translație identică cu a dvs. există (cu simbolul Crowd) trebuie aleasă cea care există (ideal cea Globală). Clicați pe simbolul dischetă și translația va apare cu numele dvs și un trade mark TM.
Altfel vom avea o serie de translații identice, care nu are nici un sens.

        <note from="Chris B. (Chris.B.)" priority="4">@Inkoming I don't understand why you delete the word "action" from your translation. In several langages, the word is in the translation.
For the rest of your proposal, I'm ok, it will be better with "délai d'expiration" instead of "expiration du délai".</note>
        <note from="Inkoming" priority="4">Hey Chris. I thought about it for nearly two days and initially went for the one you submitted. But there's an ugly display inconsistency on some smaller-size phones, and this minor update helps to fix it WITHOUT any prejudice to the general understanding.

So the string without the word "action" is coming and is linked with the first one: "Délai d'expiration du coffre": https://gcdnb.pbrd.co/images/hcvWQRFIehm2.jpg

By the way, the prompt is obvious (I asked 5 french people around me): https://gcdnb.pbrd.co/images/c8rxGCXKccPF.png

More than just an easy translation here, this one is more about the general visual consistency of the app. We should go for it if we can help without breaking anything (if the localization is NOT creating any difficulties or misunderstandings). It's the case for this string IMO.

I corrected some much deeper issues than this one these past 48 hours; you can check by yourself.

By the way, web, browser, and desktop versions keep their whole string with "Action". 

Anyway, I'll be able to update to the most upvoted one.

PS: Many people are talking about the UI improvements expected from bw. This one is a perfect illustration at NO cost to the devs. Everyone wants to get the shiniest &amp; clean app. Don't you think so?</note>

Not sure I get your question.

The form "manage" does have a pretty broad significance in AE, but so does "håndtere" in DA.
Can't think of any examples right off the bat where "håndtere" can't be used as a 1:1 translation of "manage", though I'm sure there are probably one or two instances.</note>

        <note from="Kent B. Hansen (kbh4)" priority="4">@NCAA I don't agree - it's used to set how many numbers should, at the minimum, be in a generated password. Concatenated "minimumcifre" sounds as referring to the value of the numbers. A better translation is "mindste antal cifre", but that string is to long for the GUI.</note>
        <note from="NCAA" priority="4">@kbh4:
That's your prerogative of course.

However, had the alternate suggestion read "Minimumsciffer", your sentiments would've been correct. The current suggestion merely indicates "Min. antal cifre" (plural).

Unfortunately, in AE "number" and "digit" are used intercahangeably, which means many developers use the first option rather than the latter one. In my opinion, the latter one is the correct one since a password isn't a number per se, but rather a (random) selection of digits. That these digits form a number, well that's pretty much beside the point in this context.

A definite hurdle for translators is too short localization strings. It appears that many project owners don't take into accont the need for more space when localizing to certain languages, and this inspite of the fact that the crowdin platform covers this aspect as well. The problem just seems to be widely ignored by project owners, which regrettably leads to their software containing than optimal localization results.

I assume this is a direct result of two factors, firstly, that it requires quite a piece of work to ensure the optimum localization results for all project languages and secondly, that crowdin doesn't just charge a fixed subscription fee, but charges according to a number of utilization parameters as well, which may very well pose an economic challenge for smaller projects (companies).</note>

The Chinese language uses considerably more commas to separate sentences (or parts of a sentence) than English does. I personally think when two sentences have some context among them, it's better to use a comma as separator than a period despite what they are written originally in English.

        <note from="NCAA" priority="4">@kbh4:
As far as I know, "app" is, in fact, an abbreviation of "application", initially coined by Apple in conjunction with the launch of its first iPhone (I guess to signify the difference of platform, and of course, to stand out...!). I saw some years back that Google also recommends the term "app" when coding for the Android OS.

Once again I point out, that abiding blindly by the recommendations of DSN, that doesn't yet have any rule sets adapted to the special/specialized lingo (and formatting/construction) often seen in mobile software texts, doesn't always serve the users of said software in the best way possible. 

And again, here the apostrophe serves further purposes, to remove the need for conscious processing (intuitively/instinctively comprehension) and it serves as an attraction/focus point in texts in general.</note>

Unlock with biometrics, Unlock with Face ID and Unlocke with Touch ID. But while Biometrics isn't necessarily an Android feature name (the presentation varies between manufacturers), it may very well be in Bitwarden's scope.

Edit: on my test device (Android) this results in a non-capitalized "Sblocca con codice PIN" right below a capitalized "Sblocca con Dati biometrici". I'm not sure if the latter can be fixed with a lowercase initial, so I posted here.</note>

"Automaattitäytä"

This is the text on the action button in the app that autofills your login details, so it should be translated as such. Just like the other button right next to it, which says "Automaattitäytä ja tallenna".

(I assume this is the correct string because the context says it's a verb, but if not then apply this to whichever of the other "Autofill" strings is the one that corresponds with the text on the button I am talking about)</note>
        <note from="Oskari Lavinto (olavinto)" priority="4">@finl Hmm. I can't see any such button in the mobile app either, not on Android or iOS. Unless you mean the Android notification area button? Also, here too this is also used for the settings section since it's the only fitting string - and that isn't a verb.

Here are a few screenshots:

Bitwarden changed a while ago though and there has been overlap and kind of a habit of breaking strings into pieces, or not providing different plural forms in a way that makes them very difficult, or even impossible to translate correctly. So I wouldn't be that surprised if this was also used as a verb and a noun (impossible to translate correctly). It used to be very well built for localization but the quality dropped drastically lastduring the last year or two, and support is non existent at Crowdin. The projects were also supposed to be combined into one to avoid translating the same strings multiple times, but that never happened either, and instead we just got a whole lot more new ones. 😥🙂</note>
        <note from="finl" priority="4">@olavinto

When you are on a login field on your mobile device and Bitwarden detects it, you get that little "Bitwarden - My vault" button on your keyboard's toolbar. Tapping it opens the app, after which you can either tap on a matching login detail it has detected OR search for other ones in your vault.

If you do the latter and then tap on any of those login details, you get a little popup menu asking "Haluatko täyttää kohteen automaattisesti vai tarkastella sitä?" (string 1732?), with the options "Automaattitäyttö", "Automaattitäytä ja tallenna" and "Näytä" below it.

So clearly the text on the first button is not right and should be matching the second button.

Admittedly this is not a menu you will see very often, because any login details that have a matching domain or app name saved on them will just be automatically recognized by Bitwarden. And tapping on those will just autofill them directly.

But there are some apps where Bitwarden does not automatically know which login detail they belong to. The Steam app for example (at least previously) was one of these, and I had to manually find the app's package name and add it as a URI under the login detail. Before doing that, or on any other apps that Bitwarden cannot automatically match to something, you'll be seeing this menu when you have to manually search for the login detail you want to autofill.

On Crowdin's context field it says this a verb, and there's a 7 year old comment stating it is one too. But I get that if they are also using this string in other places as a noun, it will inevitably be wrong in one place or another so who cares. Probably best to have it be proper in the places where it's visible more often.</note>
        <note from="Oskari Lavinto (olavinto)" priority="4">@finl Oh yeah, I did not check the search, and I have had all my logins for apps and sites saved for a long time now so I haven't used the autofill search for probably several months and didn't think to check it now. I will try to open a GitHub issue for this because there should be separate strings for the options (which are clear nouns) and for the on you mentioned. Unless one or the other comes from somewhere else.

I believe that I have originally opted to handle this as a verb because it appears in the settings.

Also, I do care very much that we use correct forms, and that we are able to do so. Personally I hate using stuff in Finnish if the translations are all over the place, especially since I get by with English just as well. For me it is kind of pointless to dedicate my time to this if I'm not able to provide high quality. I get that it's different for those users who actually need the translations to be able to use things at all, but I am extremely picky about this.</note>

"Credencial"</note>
        <note from="Gabriel Ribeiro (K0media)" priority="4">@Romoaldo, verifique se essa string está se referindo a "Iniciar Sessão", Login (literal) ou Credencial mesmo, pois eu não pude verificar no app ainda.

Por "TypeLogin" pude entender que é para digitar o login (ou nome de usuário). Então acho que "Login" (sem tradução) seria o mais viável aqui.

Tem que ser revisto.</note>
        <note from="Romoaldo Cordeiro dos Santos Júnior (Romoaldo)" priority="4">@K0media Já verifiquei. Essa tradução aparece quando vamos adicionar um item no aplicativo do celular. Quando o menu de opções é exibido questionando que tipo de informação queremos armazenar, aparece as seguintes opções:

Iniciar Sessão (o correto é Credencial)
Cartão
Identidade
Nota Segura

Acredito que na próxima atualização a tradução estará correta.</note>

        <note from="Gabriel Ribeiro (K0media)" priority="4">@Romoaldo, certo. Acabei pensando que era a string logo da tela de login do Bitwarden (login/senha), por isso questionei.</note>
        <note from="Romoaldo Cordeiro dos Santos Júnior (Romoaldo)" priority="4">@K0media Não é da tela de login. Percebi este erro a dois dias e levei um susto. Por falta de informação de contexto, traduzi errado e o desenvolvedor lançou. Espero que ele atualize logo.</note>

        <note from="Vividly8487" priority="4">@Scifire Thanks I found where it is into bitwarden app.

The options to chose a "brand" into bitwarden are Visa, Mastercard, American Express... "Type" et "Marque" dones't really make sense since those are "réseaux de paiement". I am going to fix the app bitwarden projects.</note>

It's used since the beginning instead of Raccolte to translate Collections, that are simply groups of items, notes, password that you can manage in your Organization.

"Host"

In the German versions of desktop app, browser extension and in the web vault the translation for this already is "Host". In the help sites and in the English version itself it is "host" as well.

"Server"  is inconsistent with the other apps and the English help sites - and more important, it really doesn't seem to be the right translation for "host".

BTW I'm German.</note>

We already translated by "autocomplétion", "saisie automatique", "préremplissage"... Autocomplétion is the best technical word IMO but "saisie automatique" speaks for itself and it's widely used. What do you think?</note>

17 minute

V-am modificat traducerea și vă dau explicațiile aici (sunt în engleză dar vă descurcați). E util de știut și pentru traduceri unde sunt 3 variante (1sg și 2 pluraluri - unul pentru 2-19, altul puntru 20-infinit). Pe site nu este clar.

The plural noun do not change but there is a rule that says:

♥ after numbers greater than 19 must be added the preposition "de":

ONE------------------TWO-------------------OTHER

1 zi-----------------19 zile---------------20 de zile (1 milion de zile)
1 oră----------------2-19 ore--------------20 de ore (1000 de ore)
1 săptămână----------2-19 săptămâni--------20 de săptămâni
1 an-----------------2-19 ani--------------20 de ani (66 de ani)
1 dolar--------------2-19 dolari-----------20 de dolari
1 euro----------     2-19 euro-------------20 de euro

♥ Also, the preposition "de" is used in front of a second noun accompanied (determined) by the numeral, when thousands, millions and billions are rendered in words, and not in numbers: 20 "de" billions of euros.

1 leu---------------2-19 lei---------------20 de mii de lei

Exceptions:

a) ♥♥After decimals numbers, abbreviations and symbols, preposition "de" is not used
b) ♥♥If the noun is abbreviated ex.: "m" for "milion"

1,25 francs---------2,85 francs-----------20, 45 francs
1 $-----------------2-19 $----------------20 $, 35 $ etc.
1 zi----------------2-19 zile-------------1 m zile (for 1 milion de zile)
1 RON---------------2-19 RON--------------20 RON, 58 RON etc

Look at the bottom of the page 21 the last 3 points.

I think the 2 pages:

https://kb.adguard.com/en/miscellaneous/plurals#3type
should be updated with explanations for romanian language.

        <note from="Archived (dwbit)" priority="4">@olavinto Great question! The component is a 'note' or 'secure note' and you can put as much or as little content in there as you like.</note>
        <note from="mKoonrad" priority="4">@dwbit Could you stop changing strings? You should create new string and delete old. Most projects work this way. Changing text and approval status it's very annoying. This causes more problems.</note>
        <note from="Archived (dwbit)" priority="4">@mKoonrad Hi there! Can you provide context on what you mean? Our source strings are updated/configured through an automated development sync through Github. Are you referring to going from 'Copy Notes' to 'Copy Note'? I want to better understand why this is causing an issue so that I can look into it.</note>
        <note from="mKoonrad" priority="4">@dwbit Please add just fresh, new string without translating history. Currently, many strings contains many outdated translations unrelated to the current source text</note>
        <note from="Archived (dwbit)" priority="4">@mKoonrad So after chatting with the team about this one, they suggested it's better to have an out of date translation that will soon be translated, than going back to english version. Let me know if  that clears things up, or if you have any  questions.

Do you want to provide a specific example and I can review?</note>

        <note from="REMOVED_USER" priority="4">@dwbit Does this refer to "Biometric unlock for the Auto-fill function"?

There is a very similar string without the "Autofill" part.

By the way, Bitwarden is using "Autofill", "AutoFill", "Auto-fill", "autofill" and "auto-fill" in different source strings, I guess this always is the same function?</note>
        <note from="Archived (dwbit)" priority="4">@accolon Yes, the team is working on continuity there, thanks for flagging. The autofill is just at the front because you will get blocked during mobile app autofill if this action needs to be performed. </note>

Contrary to the use in hardcopy media, this pronoun can be considered as intrusive, violating the user's privacy, and borderline offensive in certain circumstances, contexts, and phrasings when used in ordinary software UI strings/texts.
In addition, using "we", "our" or "us" in ordinary UI texts doesn't benefit or enlighten the user in any way, and since the conventions for copywriting hardcopy and software texts aren't identical (contrary to what some seem to believe and claim), there's no real reason or need to ever use "we", "our" or "us" in ordinary UI texts.
When the topic is legal matters, software aimed at kids, special-purpose software, games, etc., then this 'limitation' doesn't apply, at least no in quite the same way.

Hmm, strange...</note>
        <note from="Oskari Lavinto (olavinto)" priority="4">@GobinathAL @NCAA I'm also not aware of where this can be seen in the app but based on the "UpdateMasterPasswordWarning" string I'm pretty sure that it is related to a situation where your account is managed by/linked to an organization where an administrator has changed your master password through the organisation and then you must update your account/client app to reflect this change.

Edit: Check the "updateMasterPasswordWarning" string on the browser extension translation.</note>

        <note from="Gabriel Ribeiro (K0media)" priority="4">To Brazilian translators: I've been thinking about a proper translation for "login/log in/logging in/etc" terms and variants.

Of course, it will depend on the context to see what fits best in each case, but in overall terms, we should have an standard for this.

There are words in specific that can fit in these cases:
1. "Login" (no translation);
2. "Entrar" ("to enter", like "signing in");
3. "Acessar" ("to access").

In some cases the word "Login" itself would refer to credentials, so we could use "credencial(is)" for such scenarios.

There are other variations, but I believe these ones are the most relevant.

Please consider talking about these possibilities, so we can provide a better localization for these terms.

In my own opinion, I believe "acessar" would fit best in most of cases.


I'll review the remaining strings related to these terms as soon as this gets settled.</note>

        <note from="Bartosz Wilczyński (bartw)" priority="4">@mKoonrad There is an issue with the translation (rather locales) of the interface from Polish. On one of the screens in mobile app text should be "Wróć do aplikacji".  Instead of that there is rubbish in place of national characters.

While I am logging to mobile app with Yubikey NFC NEO on Android device (Samsung S20 5G FE) I am promted with question to choose app for next step (strangely enough Bitwarden app which I have installed on and configured is not shown there). I am not sure if I should be prompted with it (maybe it is some issue with my phone configs).</note>
        <note from="mKoonrad" priority="4">@bartw Nie jestem pewien jak mogę z tym pomóc, bo nie widzę żadnego oryginalnego ciągu "Go back to the app." A tutaj nie widzę żadnego problemu https://github.com/bitwarden/mobile/blob/7e9b7398c8564b197c149781a543b105481b2b9f/src/App/Resources/AppResources.pl.resx#L2090</note>

Once again, I don't think it's a good idea when people approve their own translations, overriding the voting system.</note>
        <note from="Archived (dwbit)" priority="4">@accolon Thanks for letting us know. You should be able to add the correct translate and downvote the incorrect one, which will change the selected translation.</note>
        <note from="Johannes (j_kers)" priority="4">Hi @accolon and @dwbit, Please have a look in the forum, we have jointly decided to use the capitalized Form "Du". Hence, the correction.</note>
        <note from="REMOVED_USER" priority="4">@j_kers Thanks, can you point me to the corresponding forum thread? I found two recent discussions about "du"/"Du"/"Sie" in the community forums, but don't see any decisions made there.

IMHO "Du" would be okay-ish (although uncommon), but currently most translations for Bitwarden use "du" (I even found a recent one made by you when clicking through the bitwarden-mobile project). I personally just don't like a mixture of both forms because it looks very inconsistent, just like the sporadic "Sie" still used in older translations.</note>

        <note from="Dženan (Dzenan)" priority="4">@Flaz I believe it refers to “Watch” as in “Apple Watch”.

        <note from="Archived (dwbit)" priority="4">@Dzenan That is correct, Apple Watch beta is now available.</note>
        <note from="Alexander Hermann (alexander-hermann)" priority="4">The term 'Smartwatch' is more specific than 'Uhr.' Given the diverse features and capabilities of smartwatches today, such as fitness tracking, notifications, etc., the specific mention of 'Smartwatch' provides users with a clearer idea of the intended device.

...and a big fat +1 on this one!   :-)

You don't "enable a permission", you "grant a permission" or "grant/allow access".

Alternatively, you could use "Enable camera access..."/"Allow camera access..." if, for some reason, "grant" is not a desired term.

However, "grant" is the technically correct term.</note>

        <note from="finl" priority="4">I don't think "suojausavain" is the correct word to use for translating "passkey".

That's what the physical security devices like YubiKeys and Titan Security Keys are called. All the big companies like Google, Microsoft and Apple use that word for them.

Better words for "passkey" would be "avainkoodi", which is what Google calls them, or "todentamisavain", which is the word Microsoft, Apple and others use.</note>
        <note from="finl" priority="4">@olavinto My logic for technical terms like these would be to just go based on what people will find if they were to look them up.

If someone installs the app and doesn't know what a "suojausavain" is yet, they will Google it. All the top links they will see will be for support articles on these big companies' sites, talking about the physical security key devices.

Whereas searching for "todentamisavain" or "avainkoodi" will actually get you links to passkey-related pages.

So I'm not saying we must use one of these two words just because they did so, these are just what I could come up with quickly. I am sure there are other words being used by others too (AFAIK passkeys are still a relatively new thing for normal sites/platforms like Google, so I get it's inconsistent).

I simply believe using this one specific term "suojausavain" doesn't seem like a good idea, when it's already being popularly used as the word for the security keys.

And yeah I see these are from a year ago, so I have no idea how these words were being used back then, whether any of those support pages for the big companies even existed yet (in Finnish at least), etc.

Either way, I got bored and re-did all the strings that had this word in them. I kept everything else the same as what had already been approved. Did them all twice, with both of the two alternative words I mentioned above. Maybe it saves you time if you decide to go with one of these instead. If not, not a big deal, lol.</note>
        <note from="Oskari Lavinto (olavinto)" priority="4">@finl Muutin nyt kaikki (nähdäkseni) passkeyt käännökselle "pääsyavain", kun se on noiden kolmen jätin termeistä mielestäni osuvin. Muutan vielä tämän/huomisen aikana noi kaikki security keyt suojausavaimiksi kunhan kerkiän. Siivoan nyt omat romaanini tästä ketjusta pois. :)</note>
        <note from="finl" priority="4">@olavinto Juu, paremmalta tuo termi kyllä kuulostaa minustakin, kuin nuo kaksi aiemmin ehdottamaani vaihtoehtoa.</note>
        <note from="Oskari Lavinto (olavinto)" priority="4">@finl Toisaalta voidaan pohtia, miksei se oo vaan "sala-avain"? Kun siis password on kerrran salasana. 😄</note>

        <note from="Oskari Lavinto (olavinto)" priority="4">@FaviFake @lyubomirv @NCAA This has a StyleClass="settings-header" and it is a part of the settings reorganization commit, and the biometrics and PIN unlocking options seem to be under it.

See: https://github.com/bitwarden/mobile/commit/e97a37222a296386381c390fc93acca67bad160e#diff-03b0d2b320dadcd0d7ea9c66426f73abd6ed1238d3a325494e25172c6eb76b45R47

If interested, you can find these relatively easily by checking when the string was added here (click the three dot menu icon that is right above the string view next to the arrows and select "Translation history"). Then go to Bitwarden's GitHub (linked above), click on the "#### commits" that is right up the file list and see the commit(s) for the same date. You can then simply use your browser's "Search in page" feature and search with the source string (or use GitHub's search field with some options). :)</note>
        <note from="FaviFake" priority="4">@olavinto Thanks, I didn't know you could do that. So, based on the things you described, does this mean "You need to unlock these options" or "Settings regarding unlocking your vault"?</note>
        <note from="Oskari Lavinto (olavinto)" priority="4">@FaviFake Benefits of open source - you can see the code. A d since things are largely based on web and similar technologies, they are often relatively easy to figure out even without actual programming experience.

It is a title for a settings section that contains options for vault unlocking. So, "Settings regarding unlocking your vault". The settings seemed to be the same as they are in the current version, they have just been reorganized into a seöarate section.</note>
        <note from="FaviFake" priority="4">@olavinto Thank you! I'll mark my issue as resolved</note>
        <note from="NCAA" priority="4">@olavinto (&amp; @dwbit):
Thx.

Very commendable that you take the time to investigate such aspects, however, not all may have time to do that or are not, for whatever reason, inclined to do so, which is why such info should preferably be included in the CONTEXT section.
The risk of omitting such info may be erroneous translations, i.e., based on guesswork — I've seen many examples of this in various projects over the years.

It's far from all source texts that require context info, only the ones that may be ambiguous (like this source text), contain (certain) technical aspects/references, or are not otherwise straightforward in terms of meaning if one is but a layman.

Ideally, a translator shouldn't need to leave this platform (to look up external-based references, etc.) in order to perform localization tasks on crowdin.</note>
        <note from="Oskari Lavinto (olavinto)" priority="4">@NCAA Yeah, I occasionally dabble. @dwbit has been marked as "archived" and I doubt that anyone follows the account anymore. I had some pms with him and he pointed out that Crowdin's messaging system isn't very user friendly and it seems to be too simple for managing larger projects (it basically floods admins with notifications yet offers no good way of managing a high volume of them. It could probably use some sort of ticketing system so that admins could follow things better. I started to occasionally check the commits out myself when comments didn't get much responses for a while. They can offer a lot of insight into what is coming and how new strings may fit (commits also usually come with descriptions of what they change, like reorganizing settings or fixing something specific etc.). Benefits of open source although one should, of course, have at least some understanding of UI design and code syntax to be able to actually gain anything from it. Technically, anyone could contribute by adding string descriptions to localization files at GitHub (if their contribution guidelines allow this).

Bitwarden also offers very comprehensive and (surprisingly) up to date support resources that include step by step guides with screenshots etc. and they cover most (if not all) current features. It can be a great information source about Bitwarden specific technologies and terminology (but also requires some context so stuff doesn't get mixed).
&gt; https://bitwarden.com/help/

I also have the advantage of managing three different Bitwarden subscriptions from Personal to Teams. Enterprise features are the only ones that I can't check out myself in finished product and for these the help site is very useful.</note>
        <note from="NCAA" priority="4">@olavinto:
Not a big surprise to hear about the calamities of messaging system.
Bitwarden isn't alone in deciding not to rely on it, many other projects have had to make the same decision because they simply couldn't trust things like notifications to reach the right recipients in due time, just to mention one drawback of the system.
Quite peculiar that crowdin haven't fixed this yet, as this issue has existed all the way back from when crowdin was initially launched to the broad public.

There is one other problem with this system, though, which is the misuse of it (massive spamming), at least as far as I've been told.
According to a PM of one of the projects I contribute to, they typically received close to a thousand spam messages on a daily basis, which was why they had stopped using (and monitoring) the messaging system altogether.
The only way to contact them directly is through email.</note>

        <note from="Entourage9869" priority="4">@HeartCore In all other apps in German - browser extension, desktop app, web vault - it is called "Tresor-Timeout". I would think it is better to use consistent terms around all apps. (for some users it is difficult enough)

BTW: in English, even in the help sites it is consistently called "vault timeout". The German translation for "vault" would be "Tresor". And another BTW: maybe "session-timeout" seems to be an inconsistent use for the English version of the mobile app, then?!</note>

        <note from="Entourage9869" priority="4">@HeartCore In German, the term "asset link" is not common knowledge. As I understand it, an asset link is some kind of "connection link" - so maybe "Verknüpfungs-/Verbindungs-Link" would be a better translation, so that a German reader would have a bit of a clue what it would mean... But I put "asset link" in brakes, because if this is a defined term, it should be there additional, so that one can search for it in English.</note>
        <note from="HeartCore" priority="4">@Entourage9869 Asset links are a technical term and integrated into the Android operating system. This error message seems to be very specific and an additional translation of the term would be unnecessary as it wouldn't provide any extra info. I will stick with it for now, but might change it based on future development or developer feedback. You can read more about it here: https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/verify-android-applinks</note>

"Bitwarden - Gerenciador de Senhas"</note>
        <note from="Romoaldo Cordeiro dos Santos Júnior (Romoaldo)" priority="4">@K0media A frase "Password Manager" está no singular. Além disso, o desenvolvedor pede que tenha no máximo 30 caracteres. Trinta e dois caracteres foi o máximo que consegui.

Pensei em mudar a frase "Gerenciador de Senha" para "Gestão de Senha". Mas soa estranho por parecer Português de Portugal.

O que acha?</note>
        <note from="Gabriel Ribeiro (K0media)" priority="4">@Romoaldo, estranho.. Na contagem de caracteres eu vejo 27 ao invés de 30.

Pensei que "Gerenciador de Senhas" seria mais viável porque é bem lógico que ele não gerencia apenas UMA senha, mas sim várias.

Se há uma limitação de caracteres e temos que respeitar, assim seja.

Mas ao meu ver, "Gerenciador de Senhas" ficaria muito melhor do que algo genérico para algo que contextualmente seria "errôneo".
Esse é o meu ponto de vista.</note>
        <note from="Romoaldo Cordeiro dos Santos Júnior (Romoaldo)" priority="4">@K0media Já que ambos ultrapassam 30 caracteres vou considerar a sua tradução. Realmente fica mais agradável no plural.</note>
        <note from="Kyle @Bitwarden (kspearrin)" priority="4">30 characters max</note>
        <note from="Gabriel Ribeiro (K0media)" priority="4">@kspearrin, you said up to 30 chars, but even that I submitted the translation "Bitwarden - Gerenciador de Senhas" (that is 26 chars long), you just corrected to "Bitwarden".

Should it be kept that way to keep it simple or make it brief in less than 30 chars?

Although the string label is just "Name", but maybe it still apply.</note>

        <note from="Oskari Lavinto (olavinto)" priority="4">@kennymc-c @NCAA @FaviFake @HeartCore This belongs to the smart watch app. I am not entirely sure but most likely this appears as a noun, probably as a placeholder in a search field or as a simple header since there don't seem to be other "search" strings in the GitHub project and a watch doesn't have a lot of screen space.</note>

        <note from="mKoonrad" priority="4">@kspearrin In Polish language (and many more) there is more than one plural form (one few many other form). You need to adjust this string to support plural to prepare correct translation to each variable case. https://support.crowdin.com/icu-message-syntax/ For now I prepare translation like "password should contain at least..." to avoid this issue.</note>

What exact type of "License number" is this/what's the context?

This has generated some questionable translation outputs in the past because no one could clarify the exact nature of this "License number".
For instance, this is used about "driver's license number" just to mention one output possibility.

I assume this refers to, e.g., a software license number, but without any clarifying context info, it's anyone's guess what the exact meaning is.</note>

        <note from="mKoonrad" priority="4">@kspearrin In Polish language (and many more) there is more than one plural form (one few many other form). You need to adjust this string to support plural to prepare correct translation to each variable case. https://support.crowdin.com/icu-message-syntax/ For now I prepare translation like "password should contain at least..." to avoid this issue.</note>

        <note from="Oskari Lavinto (olavinto)" priority="4">We should be able to inflect the variable's strings to construct this sentence fluently. Now we are force to twist it into something wierd due to being forced to consider the uninflected base forms. Master password works here because we can freely use any form for it.

For an example: "PIN" would have to be PIN-koodilla which means exactly "with PIN code". Here [PIN-koodi] is the base form but in this case it needs [lla] ending. "Biometrics" would become "Biometrialla" (= "with biometrics"), and [Biometria][lla]. Same with "master password" which becomes [pääsalasana][lla].

Now, using a variable here is fine BUT only if the variable's strings are not used in other contexts that require forms other than this does. So basically this string should have its own strings OR there should simply be three (or however many are required) different variations of this whole sentence.</note>

        <note from="Edgars (eandersons)" priority="4">@lyubomirv, I believe it is an analogy to a device that is recording an essential information about a flight, in some countries also known as a black box. In this context it could be a place where logs are collected, probably something like debugging mode or something like that. Disclaimer: I am just guessing.</note>
