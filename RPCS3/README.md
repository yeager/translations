Create the folder qt6/translations within the RPCS3 main folder.

Download the rpcs3_empty.ts and rename it to your language code (i.e "fr" for French, like "rpcs3_fr.ts")
Open the file in Qt Linguist and translated it. Do not edit the file in a normal text editor.
Release the file in Linguist to create the .qm file (or use Qt lrelease)

Copy the .qm file to qt6/translations, start RPCS3 and select your language from the menu.
